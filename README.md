## README
A MonoMac test app, based on an the port of the XCode RoundedDisplayWindow sample from MonoMacSamples
https://github.com/mono/monomac/tree/master/samples/RoundedTransparentWindow

Updated with a custom transparent shape for window - Not for anyone with a weak stomach!

Should make a good template for a scary set of personal custom mac apps
