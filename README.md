An adaptation of the port of the XCode RoundedDisplayWindow sample from MonoMacSamples
http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/RoundTransparentWindow/Introduction/Intro.html
Slightly updated to avoid using the deprecated APIs in the sample.

And updated with a custom transparent shape for window ..
